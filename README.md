# electron-panel-window

Enables creating a browser window in Electron that behaves like a [Panel](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspanel). Panels are typically used for auxillary windows and do not activate the application â€“ as such they can appear ontop of other apps in the same way as Spotlight or 1Password, for example.

## Usage

Use `PanelWindow` as you would [BrowserWindow](https://electronjs.org/docs/api/browser-window). All of the methods exposed in this module **must be used** on the main process. Using the methods in a renderer process will result in your app crashing.

```javascript
import { PanelWindow } from "electron-panel-window";

const win = new PanelWindow({
  width: 800,
  height: 600,
  show: false,
});

// the window will show without activating the application
win.show();
```

You can also access the utility methods directly:

```javascript
import { remote } from "electron";
import { makePanel, makeKeyWindow } from "electron-panel-window";

const currentWindow = remote.getCurrentWindow();

// convert the window to an NSPanel
makePanel(currentWindow);

// focus the window without activating the application
makeKeyWindow(currentWindow);
```

## Development

To compile the extension for the first time, run

```bash
$ yarn
$ yarn install
```

All subsequent builds only need `yarn build`. Tests run in Spectron:

```bash
$ yarn test
```

## Debugging steps

1. After bumping into an error, you're supposed to see something like:
   ```
   0   com.github.Electron.framework 	0x000000010a0c976f 0x107e9e000 + 35829615
   ```
2. Download `dSYM` from https://github.com/electron/electron/releases, launch `atos` like: `xcrun atos -o "Electron Framework.dSYM/Contents/Resources/DWARF/Electron Framework" -l 0x10a620000 -arch x86_64`, and type `0x000000010c84b76f`
3. You should see the line triggering the error:
   ```
   -[AtomNSWindowDelegate windowWillClose:] (in Electron Framework) (atom_ns_window_delegate.mm:248)
   ```
